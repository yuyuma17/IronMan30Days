# TapCounterPlus
Hi, I'm Lacie, an iOS developer.

This is a game about getting scores as many as you can do by tapping the button in 5 seconds.

If you like this project, you can press â˜…Star to follow it.

And if you are good at Chinese, you can see the [article](https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/articles/10228208) I wrote about the process while doing the project.
